                  <li>Before we get started, there is a new December release coming from Kentucky Owl so be on the lookout for red, blue, and green ink bottles soon.</li>
                  <li>Erik, how did you get into bourbon?</li>
                  <li>Tell us what you do with your twitter handle, <a href="https://twitter.com/BourbonSeason">@BourbonSeason</a></li>
                  <li>There’s a lot of ways to get allocated bourbons, have you found a good formula for getting special release bourbons?</li>
                  <li>Have you seen special hunting groups that have formed?</li>
                  <li>Have you seen more camp out situations in other parts of the country?</li>
                  <li>There’s camping, lotteries, and being a "best" customer but is there a fair way to distribute allocated bottles?</li>
                  <li>In Louisville the secondary market is starting to take its effect. Small shops are selling bottles for secondary prices. Are you seeing this in other parts of the country as well?</li>
                  <li>When you think about the secondary market there are fingers to point. Are people flipping the bottles or buying the bottles the culprit of the problem?</li>
                  <li>How do you feel about seeing the flipper "crotch shot"?</li>
                  <li>Some people on forums are selling 2 or 3 full verticals of Pappy or BTAC, so how are these people feeding the secondary market?</li>
                  <li>In Louisville, we have a few restaurants that have fantastic selections, but they are price gouging. No question about it. Do you see restaurants as contributing to the secondary market as well?</li>
                  <li>Are the distilleries going to start charging more to combat and make more money for themselves?</li>
                  <li>This week, Buffalo Trace sent out an email responding to the mass inquiries about secondary market pricing and they intend on trying to shut down secondary markets. Can Buffalo Trace successfully shut it down?</li>
                  <li>Would you like to see Buffalo Trace crack down on stores and restaurants that price gouge since the three-tier system is the only way a consumer can get a bottle?</li>

                  <li>What made you so fascinated that you took the time to become an author on the subject?</li>
                  <li>Talk about the misquote of bourbon being a “distinctive product of the United States”.</li>
                  <li>Talk about the beginning with the “Big Bang of Bourbon”.</li>
                  <li>In the book, you talk about myths behind the labels.</li>
                  <li>Let’s jump ahead in history, there was a lot going on in 1964. Can you talk about what was going on during that time period?</li>
                  <li>What was the result of The Bourbon Institute in overseas markets?</li>
                  <li>There is a concept of marketing that has changed the way in what you think you’re drinking.</li>
                  <li>You said (paraphrasing) “Rosenstiel presided over vicious consolidation rounds that made many distillers and brands extinct, but is also a part of the reason why many bourbons today taste as good as they do”. Talk about that. How come his name isn’t as prominent as EH Taylor for Bottled-in-Bond?</li>
                  <li>How come we don’t see a bourbon or whiskey brand named Rosenstiel?</li>
                  <li>Within the prologue, you talk about bourbon being a “comfort food”. Talk about that.</li>
                  <li>If you want to buy <a href="hhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O2BS47O">Bourbon Empire</a>, it’s available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O2BS47O">Amazon</a>.</li>

                <p><img src="images/bio/ryan.png" align="right" style="width: 50%;border-radius:15px;">Ryan grew up in Bardstown, KY, which most people know as the bourbon capital of the world.  He has been surrounded by the bourbon industry and seen it grow and flourish throughout his life. Many of his closest friends and relatives work at the local distilleries such as Heaven Hill, Willett, and Jim Beam. All these close ties keep him in the loop of the latest bourbon news and access to some insider trade secrets. Bourbon used to be a means of wild partying, but has now grown into a deep appreciation for positive impact for his state and hometown. Some of Ryan's favorite bourbons are Elijah Craig, Willett Family Estate, and W.L. Weller 12.</p>
                <p>Ryan's real job is owner/partner of <a href="http://gogreenlawnsolutions.com/">Go Green Lawn Solutions</a>, a turf management company, and <a href="http://www.bitefreebackyard.com/">Mosquito 911</a>, a pest control company.</p>

                <p><img src="images/bio/kenny.png" align="right" style="width: 50%;border-radius:15px;">Kenny got into bourbon back in the early days of college after being recruited to a fraternity known for being the biggest bourbon drinkers on UK's campus. Back then, it was handles of Kentucky Tavern and Very Old Barton on a weekly basis. After college, Old Forrester became a staple in his post-grad home and splurged on 4 Roses Small Batch. It wasn't until 2011 when the itch hit to start buying more high-end and rare release bourbons. Since then, Kenny has been known to camp out for Pappy Van Winkle and troll liquor stores on a weekly basis waiting for those rare ones to hit the shelf.</p>
                <p>Kenny's day job is a Developer Advocate with <a href="http://emccode.github.io/">EMC {code}</a> where he spends his time speaking at tech events, being focused on DevOps methodologies, and writing code.</p>
