                <p><img src="images/bio/kenny.png" align="right" style="width: 50%;">Kenny got into bourbon back in the early days of college after being recruited to a fraternity known for being the biggest bourbon drinkers on UK's campus. Of course, back then it was handles of Kentucky Tavern being demolished on a weekly basis. After college, Old Forrester became a staple in his post-grad home and he would splurge on 4 Roses Small Batch every once in a while. It wasn't until 2012 when the itch hit to start buying more high-end and rare release bourbons. Since then, Kenny has been known to camp out for Pappy Van Winkle and troll liquor stores on a weekly basis waiting for those rare ones to hit the shelf.</p>
                <p>Kenny's day job is a Developer Advocate with EMC {code} where he spends his time speaking at tech events, being focused on DevOps methodologies, and writing code. Kenny can currently speak Ruby, Rails, Node.js, HTML5/CSS3, and jQuery.</p>
