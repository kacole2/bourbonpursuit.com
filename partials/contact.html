      <p>Do you like what you hear and want to be a guest on the show? That's great. We're always looking to interview people in the bourbon industry. Don't be shy, you don't have to be a Master Distiller. We want to know your story! Authors, coopers, apprentices, artists, family lineage, tourist attractions, etc. If it's bourbon related, lets chat! Send us an <a href="mailto:theduo@bourbonpursuit.com?Subject=Be%20A%20Guest">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bourbonpursuit">tweet</a>, or message on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bourbonpursuit">facebook</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="center">BE A SPONSOR</h2>
      <p>Ever wanted to reach a couple thousand people through a 10-20 second audio clip? We are looking for show sponsors to have their advertisement heard at the beginning of our show. It's a podcast heard all around the nation and it's an easy way to advertise for all those looking to come experience the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. Send us an <a href="mailto:theduo@bourbonpursuit.com?Subject=Be%20A%20Sponsor">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bourbonpursuit">tweet</a>, or message on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bourbonpursuit">facebook</a>.
