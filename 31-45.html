                  <li>Talk about your first memorable experience with bourbon. Good or Bad?</li>
                  <li>Talk about your background and coming into the bourbon industry</li>
                  <li>Let's talk about the Woodford grounds a little bit. It's held over 4 different names in the 200 years it's been existence.</li>
                  <li>What makes your bourbon special or unique compared to others?</li>
                  <li>There’s a misconception that Woodford is aged longer than Old Forester. Can you explain the differences?</li>
                  <li>What is the future of distilling going to be? Is it a science or art form?</li>
                  <li>You've been quoted as saying "Because we have a small distillery we use less sour mash than many distillers, which gives more fresh grain in every batch”. I know we can go to the liquor store and read a label that says Sour Mash bourbon but what does sour mash truly mean?</li>
                  <li>You also ferment the mash for nearly twice as long as other distilleries, around 6 or 7 days when most usually do 3 or 4. Again talk about the role that plays.</li>
                  <li>You do some unique experiments that are released yearly or even at the distillery. The latest masters select was called 1838 Style white Corn. Then there was another recent release called frosty four Wood. Talk about those.</li>
                  <li>Choose your favorite child</li>
                  <li>Talk about the process of the “Double Double Oaked”</li>
                  <li>It is Derby season and Woodford has some affinity with horses. Talk about your ties to the horse racing industry</li>
                  <li>Any favorite horse names over the years?</li>
                  <li>With Derby time the drink of the season if the Mint Julep, talk about the $1000 Mint Julep</li>
                  <li>I don’t know if this is fact or fiction, but is the ice actually flown in from a glacier?</li>
                  <li>How do you get your hands on one?</li>

                  <li>Before we get started, there is a new December release coming from Kentucky Owl so be on the lookout for red, blue, and green ink bottles soon.</li>
                  <li>Erik, how did you get into bourbon?</li>
                  <li>Tell us what you do with your twitter handle, <a href="https://twitter.com/BourbonSeason">@BourbonSeason</a></li>
                  <li>There’s a lot of ways to get allocated bourbons, have you found a good formula for getting special release bourbons?</li>
                  <li>Have you seen special hunting groups that have formed?</li>
                  <li>Have you seen more camp out situations in other parts of the country?</li>
                  <li>There’s camping, lotteries, and being a "best" customer but is there a fair way to distribute allocated bottles?</li>
                  <li>In Louisville the secondary market is starting to take its effect. Small shops are selling bottles for secondary prices. Are you seeing this in other parts of the country as well?</li>
                  <li>When you think about the secondary market there are fingers to point. Are people flipping the bottles or buying the bottles the culprit of the problem?</li>
                  <li>How do you feel about seeing the flipper "crotch shot"?</li>
                  <li>Some people on forums are selling 2 or 3 full verticals of Pappy or BTAC, so how are these people feeding the secondary market?</li>
                  <li>In Louisville, we have a few restaurants that have fantastic selections, but they are price gouging. No question about it. Do you see restaurants as contributing to the secondary market as well?</li>
                  <li>Are the distilleries going to start charging more to combat and make more money for themselves?</li>
                  <li>This week, Buffalo Trace sent out an email responding to the mass inquiries about secondary market pricing and they intend on trying to shut down secondary markets. Can Buffalo Trace successfully shut it down?</li>
                  <li>Would you like to see Buffalo Trace crack down on stores and restaurants that price gouge since the three-tier system is the only way a consumer can get a bottle?</li>

                  <li>Is there such a thing as “bourbon karma”?</li>

                  <li>Reid, what’s your coming to age tale of bourbon?</li>
                  <li>What made you so fascinated that you took the time to become an author on the subject?</li>
                  <li>Talk about the misquote of bourbon being a “distinctive product of the United States”.</li>
                  <li>Talk about the beginning with the “Big Bang of Bourbon”.</li>
                  <li>In the book, you talk about myths behind the labels.</li>
                  <li>Let’s jump ahead in history, there was a lot going on in 1964. Can you talk about what was going on during that time period?</li>
                  <li>What was the result of The Bourbon Institute in overseas markets?</li>
                  <li>There is a concept of marketing that has changed the way in what you think you’re drinking.</li>
                  <li>You said (paraphrasing) “Rosenstiel presided over vicious consolidation rounds that made many distillers and brands extinct, but is also a part of the reason why many bourbons today taste as good as they do”. Talk about that. How come his name isn’t as prominent as EH Taylor for Bottled-in-Bond?</li>
                  <li>How come we don’t see a bourbon or whiskey brand named Rosenstiel?</li>
                  <li>Within the prologue, you talk about bourbon being a “comfort food”. Talk about that.</li>
